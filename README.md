# Project Overview: Theatre Practice and Efficiency Analysis

Effect of change in theatre practice and shared anaesthetic room on theatre turnover and efficiency for Hip and Knee Replacement surgery

This repository contains the code and documentation for a detailed analysis project focused on optimizing theatre turnover and efficiency, particularly for hip and knee replacement surgeries. The project evaluates the impact of operational changes and shared anaesthetic room usage on surgical efficiency.

Introduction

The primary aim of this project was to analyze how changes in theatre practice and shared anaesthetic room usage affect theatre turnover times and operational efficiency. This study employed robust data analytics methodologies to provide actionable insights, helping improve overall operational effectiveness.

Project Details

Duration: June to September 2023
Scope: Focused on evaluating theatre practices, including shared versus dedicated anaesthetic rooms and their impact on surgical turnover times.
